# Interview-Frontend
Hello and thanks for taking the time to complete our interview developer test!

Feel free to do any code refactors you see fit, but keep it in JS.

## Build Setup

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

## Configs
```bash
rename .env.example to .env
```

## Tasks TODO
* Implement "Load Images" Button. The result should look as following:
  ![demo](./static/demo.png)
* Bonus: Repair the attached dockerfile and make the project available from localhost


## What we will examine:
* Clean production ready code
* Ability to fulfill the requirements
